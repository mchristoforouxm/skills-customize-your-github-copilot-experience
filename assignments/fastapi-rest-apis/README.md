# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI Framework

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to build modern, high-performance REST APIs using the FastAPI framework. Create a fully functional API with multiple endpoints that handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations for managing data resources.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Setting Up FastAPI and Creating Basic Endpoints

#### Description
Initialize a FastAPI project and create basic GET endpoint to understand routing and request handling.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Install FastAPI and uvicorn dependencies
- Create a FastAPI application instance
- Define a simple GET endpoint that returns a welcome message
- Define another GET endpoint that accepts a path parameter and returns data based on that parameter
- Run the application using uvicorn on a specified port


### 🛠️ Implementing CRUD Operations

#### Description
Build endpoints to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a specific resource (e.g., tasks, users, or products).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Define a POST endpoint to create new resource entries
- Define GET endpoint(s) to retrieve single or multiple resources
- Define a PUT endpoint to update existing resources
- Define a DELETE endpoint to remove resources
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes for each operation
- Implement request/response validation using Pydantic models


### 🛠️ Adding Functionality and Error Handling

#### Description
Enhance the API with data persistence, error handling, and proper documentation.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Store data in a simple data structure (list or dictionary) for persistence during runtime
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes
- Add input validation to ensure data integrity
- Include docstrings and comments explaining each endpoint
- Test all endpoints and document their usage (API documentation is auto-generated by FastAPI)
